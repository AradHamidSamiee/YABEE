Possible issues:
I used temporary scene copy to make changes before exporting (e.g. modifiers applying), 
it's can cause some issues.
- Incorrect material exporting on merged meshes.
- Incomplete scene clearing. Whenever we are deleted our temporary scene, 
Blender won't to delete other objects, created with the scene, so 
we should do it by hand. I recommend to save the .blend file before 
exporting and reload it after.
- Names changing.
